# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

## Project Overview
This project involves building a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

## Contents
- `CIFAR10Classification.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the step-by-step process for loading the data, defining and training the CNN, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Model Architecture
The CNN used in this project includes several convolutional layers, max pooling, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The model's architecture is designed to effectively learn feature representations for the various image classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Libraries Used
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Matplotlib

## How to Run the Notebook
Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, and run the following command at the root of this project:
```bash
jupyter notebook
